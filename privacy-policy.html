  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective date: <strong>29 October 2025</strong> • Last updated: <strong>29 October 2025</strong></p>

  <p>RIMStudio (“we”, “our”, “us”) operates automation and content tools, including integrations with
     Instagram and Facebook. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, why, how we use it, and your choices.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account & Contact</strong>: name, email, business profile details you provide.</li>
    <li><strong>Instagram/Facebook Data</strong> (only with your permission): page/account IDs, basic profile fields,
        content metadata (e.g., captions, comment text, media IDs), and events required to deliver features such as
        comment monitoring, auto-replies, or analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage & Technical</strong>: device/browser type, IP address, timestamps, logs, and error diagnostics.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Support</strong>: messages and attachments you send us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the services (e.g., publish content, respond to comments, analytics).</li>
    <li>Authenticate requests to Instagram/Facebook APIs and comply with their policies.</li>
    <li>Communicate with you about updates, security, billing, or support.</li>
    <li>Detect, prevent, and address fraud, abuse, or technical issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Legal Bases (where applicable)</h2>
  <p>We process data based on your consent, performance of a contract, legitimate interests (running and improving the
     service), and compliance with legal obligations.</p>

  <h2>4. Sharing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: infrastructure, error monitoring, or customer support vendors under NDA
        and data-processing agreements.</li>
    <li><strong>Platform Partners</strong>: data flows to Meta platforms strictly via official APIs according to your
        permissions and actions.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal/Safety</strong>: if required by law or to protect rights, safety, or integrity.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Retention</h2>
  <p>We keep data only as long as necessary for the purposes above or as required by law. You can request deletion at
     any time (see Section 10).</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures (encryption in transit, access controls, least-privilege,
     audit logs). No method is 100% secure; residual risk remains.</p>

  <h2>7. Cookies</h2>
  <p>We may use strictly necessary cookies for authentication and session management. We do not run third-party ad
     trackers on our legal pages.</p>

  <h2>8. Children</h2>
  <p>Our services are not directed to children under 13 (or the age defined by local law). We do not knowingly collect
     data from children.</p>

  <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
  <p>Data may be processed in countries different from your residence. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards
     (e.g., standard contractual clauses).</p>

  <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Access, correction, deletion, and portability of your data.</li>
    <li>Object or restrict certain processing.</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise rights or request deletion, email <a href="mailto:legal@rimstudio.co">legal@rimstudio.co</a> or follow
     the steps at our <a href="./data-deletion.html">Data Deletion page</a>.</p>

  <h2>11. Instagram/Facebook Specifics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We only access scopes you approve and only to provide requested features.</li>
    <li>We do not transfer Instagram/Facebook data to third parties except service providers under contract or as
        required by law.</li>
    <li>We delete user data upon request or after account disconnection, within a reasonable period.</li>
  </ul>
